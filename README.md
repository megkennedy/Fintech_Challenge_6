# Fintech_Challenge_6
UW Fintech Bootcamp Challenge 6
This challenge is to evaluate San Francisco real estate data for a potential rental property scenario.

## Required libraries and dependencies
import pandas as pd
import hvplot.pandas
from pathlib import Path

## Usage Issue
I ran this problem on a Macbook and received an error when attempting to use the hvplot.points function.
The error received was "ImportError: Geographic projection support requires GeoViews and cartopy."
Despite the attempts of the instructor, TA, myself, and other classmates, I was not able to resolve this error.
I submitted a request to the learning assistant for UW FinTech Bootcamp, but have not heard back.
Because of this error I am unsure if the code in the "Build an Interactive Neighborhood Map" section part 4 is correct.

## Contributors
As always I would like to thank my instructor, TAs, and classmates for their help in learning this subject matter.
